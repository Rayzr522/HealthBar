# HealthBar

> An updated version of [@filoghost's HealthBar plugin](https://github.com/filoghost/HealthBar) for 1.13

The original plugin is no longer maintained. Due to some small changes in 1.13+, the handling of nametags for entities no longer works.

I take no credit for the original work of [@filoghost](https://github.com/filoghost). I simply fixed it to work in 1.13+.

## Installation

Simply grab the latest JAR file from the [releases page](https://github.com/Rayzr522/HealthBar/releases).
