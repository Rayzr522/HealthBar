# HealthBar

> An updated version of [Filoghost's HealthBar plugin](https://github.com/Filoghost/HealthBar) for 1.13

The original plugin is no longer maintained. Due to some small changes in 1.13+, the handling of nametags for entities no longer works.

I take no credit for the original work of Filoghost. I simply fixed it to work in 1.13+.

## Installation
